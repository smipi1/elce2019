Keynote by Dana Lewis: #WeAreNotWaiting

## Software development culture clash

Open-source development: Community interactions + Agile++

SW Development expects V model

## Culture clash?

## Users demand accountability

* Feature richness + completeness is not enough

## Compatible OSS and Safety standards?

* Yes, but...

## How to approach certifications with open source?

* How used?
* Limit scope early
* Automate
* Auto-generate docs
* ...

## Build on-top of OSS strengths

* Code open
* Reviews + direct user feedback help improve quality

However:
...

## Certifications of OSS?

* No good examples
* Different perspectives / concerns

Linux Foundation Projects:

* Zephyr
* Xen project
* ELISA

## Zephyr

* Small footprint
* Safety certification open source options?
* Quality is a mandatory expectation
  ** MISRA-C
* Challenges
  ** Controversial to use
  ** Proprietary standard
  ** Proprietary tools
* Only some parts in-scope for certification now
  ** Sub-set will increase in time
* Roadmap
  ** 2021 Functional Safety Certification + Security Certification

Approach is more traditional

## ELISA

* Very healthy ecosystem
* Missing:
  * Real-time
  * Established approach for arguing safety claims
* Assessing safety requires sufficient system understanding
* Difference between safety-critical / main-line is *the way you use it*
* Continuously developed for 27+ years
* Strong cross-education task: OSS to safety and safety to OSS
* Provide a path forward for peers to collaborate towards safety certification
* Use-cases: openAPS
  ** Artificial pancreas system
* Use-case: Automotive IVI - Telltales
* Challenge is having build-tools generate appropriate information for certification

## Path forward for closing the gap / culture clash

Basis available:
* About managing risk
