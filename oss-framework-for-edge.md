# Building an Open Source Framework for the Edge - Malini Bhandaru, VMware

LF Edge

## IoT Top verticals and the edge

Large number of use-cases:

## Markets at the Edge

Industrial, Enterprise and Consumer

## Where are the edges?

Anywhere and everywhere

* Regional DC (Partial edge)
* Edge DC
* IoT gateway

Essence: close to the data-source (low latency):

* Proximity
* Responsiveness
* Mobility
* Privacy

## New umbrella for Edge projects

Drivers:

* Aligning vision
* Bring together complementary projects
* Fueling adoption
* Unify fragmented edge market
* Provide leadership

Projects:

* Akraino edge stack
* EdgeX foundry
* Fledge
* Home Edge
* EVE: Edge virtualization Engine
* Open glossary of edge computing

## Scope

Core & Cloud

Other edge activities

## Key takeaways

1. Harmonizing
1. Open and interoperable
1. Hosted by linux foundation

## Edge X Foundary

Addresses inherently fragmented IoT Edge

* Domain expertise
* Connectivity
* Application environments
* Operating systems

Platform architecture

* Loosely coupled microservices framework
* Allows building multiple pipelines for same data: Support multiple applications (use-cases)
* Provides application services such as store-and-forward (intermittent connectivity)

## EVE: Edge Virtualizion Engine

Standard architecture that is open and agnostic

Edge containers

## Akraino

* Speeds *time-to-market* with *blueprints* across industries
* Zero touch, high automation from Edge to Cloud

## Home Edge Project

* Drivers and enablers for smart-home
* Driven by Samsung
* Object templates

## FLEDGE

Similar to Edge X Foundry with focus is *critical operations*:

* Condition-based monitoring
* Predictive maintenance
* Smarter / autonomous machines
* Situation awareness

Works closely with EVE

## BAETYL

Goals:

* Cloud-native for edge scenarios
* Massive remote management
* End-to-end application dev tools

## Open Glossary for Edge Computing

Mission:

* Improve *communication and accelerate innovation* by crowd-sourcing shared vocabulary
* *vendor-neutral lexicon*

Taxonomy project

## Audience feedback

Feedback please:

* Do project complement each other? Overlap?
* Meet my needs? Gaps?
